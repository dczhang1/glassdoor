"Sep 23, 2019",Anonymous Interview Candidate,Data Analyst/Associate Interview,No Offer,Negative Experience,Difficult Interview,"I was really impressed with the initial hiring website and process. I thought that I had a good possibility of getting this position, as I have a Masters Degree in Data Analytics and several years of work experience.

The next step was to take an online assessment. The first part was behavioral and the second part was analytical/logical ability. The behavioral part was similar to any other position doing a personality test, looking for (or avoiding) particular traits.

However, the second test was something else. It starts with math and input/output code questions. I did great on those. You progress through âlevelsâ when you answer questions correctly. You only have a few minutes on each part. On the math and codes, I flew through and made it high levels. Since I was going so fast, I think that must be a good score.

Unfortunately the next few mini tests involved memorizing dots, which I am terrible at. They would show a location of a dot, have you answer some logic questions, show more dots, ask more questions, show more dots, and then ask where all the dots had been. The logic questions were fine, but not memorizing dots killed my candidacy.

I would be very interested to see how well the dot memorization predicts success in this role. While a person with a photographic memory might be helpful, it seems more important to find people capable of seeing a problem and tracking down how to find information, analyze that information, and present it in a way that explains it to the end users. I can understand and appreciate every other part of the test, but having several tests where you can only pass with a nearly photographic memory probably excludes a lot of good candidates.",Application,Memorize these dots.
