10 Apr 2019,Anonymous Interview Candidate,Java Developer,No Offer,Negative Experience,,"Horrible Experience:

I was reached out by recruiter from verizon

I was told manager will reach to you soon for in person interview.
Manager did reply me for in person interview at mid of night for next day interview.

Once reached out to recruiter seems to be it is normal for them to send email or work late hours till mid night and its normal to schedule in person interview within 10 hours. If you end up being in such team , it is going to be pain
This speaks a lot about manager and HRs
For them it is normal to work till midnight or receive email for trivial matter at mid of night and act in few hours

Usually noone sends mail at mid night if there is no production bug this speaks a lot of chaotic management of verizon",Application,technology worked on Â  Answer Question

24 May 2018,"Anonymous Interview Candidate in Denver, CO (US)",Senior Financial Analyst,Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,"Very poor process.

Started with a quick call with a Recruiter. A couple of weeks later, the hiring manager called out of the blue and scheduled an interview with me, without introducing himself. I thought he was a recruiter at first and then found out he was the hiring manager after having to ask him what his position was at Verizon.

I arrived to the one on one interview to find out it was actually a panel interview with all of his managerial reports. Would have been nice to know that ahead of time but whatever it went well. A few days later, the hiring manager called to schedule another panel interview with all of his peers plus work on a finance assignment which was to be summarized into PowerPoint and presented.

I arrived and was first walked into a room filled with the prior panel I had interviewed with plus a few additional people waiting for me. Once again, this was outside of the agenda. They asked me questions that had absolutely nothing to do with the job like what I thought about bitcoin and about companies accepting it as a form of payment. Very strange. Anyway, was then walked to the scheduled panel interview and asked very similar questions to the prior panel interview. At the end of that, I asked if we were to discuss the finance assignment I had spent time working on and he said, ânot at this time, maybe next roundâ.

Needless to say, I walked out of that interview no longer interested in the job. I was never given a chance to speak one on one with the hiring manager, not in person nor over the phone. The entire process was very impersonal and a complete waste of time.",Application,Behavioral questions Â  Answer Question

19 Aug 2017,Anonymous Employee,Customer Service Specialist,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,,Applied for the position online and received the assessment in about 2 weeks.. Passed the assessment and received a email to schedule a phone interview.. Had my phone interview; which was about 47min and before I got off the phone I was offered a second interview with a hiring manager.. Had my second interview that same week on a Friday.. Interview seemed like it was amazing and I was very confident in myself.. Before ending the second interview I was advised to wait at least a week before I heard back from Verizon.. I didn't hear back within that week but I knew it would probably be longer since Fathers Day was coming up.. After 2 weeks I tried to reach out but was not able to speak with a recruiter since I haven't heard anything.. I was advised after speaking with someone from corporate office that they were still interviewing and getting ready to make final decisions.. I received a call a month later and offered the position.. So from beginning to end it took about a month.,Application,How would you handle a irate customer?? Â  Answer Question
