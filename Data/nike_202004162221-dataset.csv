"Mar 21, 2018",Anonymous Interview Candidate in Melbourne (Australia),Sales Associate Interview,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"The whole process took almost a month. I applied for a Casual role via their website and was emailed a confirmation that I am selected to proceed to the next stage about 2-3 days after, which was a self-paced video interview where you record your responses as you go, as many times as youâd like. I didnât get any response till 2 weeks later where I got a phone call where they mentioned that I got through to the final stage which was the Assessment Centre held at their headquarters here in Melbourne.
This took 3-4 hours with the Nike team of the store I applied to being the interviewers for the day. It started off with introductions from the team members and video presentations. Then it was partner activities (get-to-know each other style) and then introducing your partner to the rest of the group. Afterwards there was more video presentations and information being said. Which led to group activities with your table group, where you discuss different topics about teamwork and then present your ideas one-by-one to everyone else. Then there was some Q&A and finally indiviudal interviews, where you wait for your name to be called in.
They email everyone about 2-4 days later regarding whether or not you got a role.

Very intensive interview. Long process. A lot of competition; they mentioned about 500 applicants applied at the beginning for this particular store for this role. And only about 50 got to the Assessment Centre stage, with only 12-20 roles up for grabs in the end.",Application,"Discuss one time you made a mistake, and how did you go about it?
