"May 25, 2018",Anonymous Interview Candidate,Legal Interview,No Offer,Negative Experience,,"I thought long and hard before writing this; but I think the HR Management at Southwest needs to know how the Recruiter assigned to the Legal Department is doing his job. I applied to Southwest earlier this year for three different Attorney positions. After several weeks, I got a call from the Recruiter wanting to set up a time to talk. The Recruiter failed to call me at our agreed upon time. I called/emailed back and he apologized and said that he forgot (Later, I found out that he did the exact same thing to a friend of mine who applied for a legal position last year). I continued on with the process because I had heard really good things about Southwest. We had the initial phone screen and he said that I was being considered for Job A (no mention of the other positions I had applied for) and said that he would be in touch with me the following week to let me know whether or not the hiring manager wanted to proceed. I never heard back from him. (Again, the same thing happened to my friend.) A month went by. Then, I got an email on a Monday stating that they wanted to fly me up to Dallas that Friday for an in person interview for the positions I applied for. Note that they did not give me any options for days and only two options for times (1:00 or 4:00). I asked which positions. They told me all three. Great! Gave me better odds, right? So, I scheduled the flights. The next day, I received an email saying I was no longer being considered for Job A (the one the Recruiter initially talked to me about). I emailed the HR Coordinator and she didn't know anything about it - said she would check with the Recruiter. Then, the next day I received an email stating that I was no longer being considered for Job B. Ok, fine. There was still one position left. Again, I emailed the Coordinator to see what was going on. She stated that she had asked the Recruiter to call me (which he never did). Additionally, I had asked for the job descriptions for the 3 positions (which were never sent). I never received any communication from the Recruiter after that initial phone screen. The process itself was unorganized - mainly due to the lack of communication from the Recruiter. The Coordinator on the other hand was very friendly and wanted to help. I ended up canceling the interview. I didn't want to take a day off of work with no pay (I'm a contractor) when I had no idea what position I was even interviewing for, what the job duties were for that position, and when the Recruiter couldn't even take the time to call me to straighten out the mess he created. I always heard that SW is a great company to work for. I guess that's true if you can get past the Recruiter assigned to your department.",Application,Why do you want to work for Southwest Airlines?

I successfully made it past my phone and face to face interview. I applied for the position in 2016 or early 2017. I received a call in Nov. 2017 asking if still interested. A phone interview was set up for Feb. 2018. A couple days after phone interview I was invited to the face to face interview. My face to face interview took place in March. Nine potential candidates for this position including myself were being interviewed. We were sequestered into a meeting room and given information about the position and background about the company. You should go in knowing about the company so do your
research. The atmosphere the flight attendants created in the room made me feel at ease. ( not so nervous) Afterwards back to the lobby we went. I met pilot candidates and of course other flight attendant candidates.

The interview itself was about 40 minutes. The interviewers made me feel at ease. They were great. I received a phone call a week later with a CJO. I was so grateful and humbled by the entire experience /offer. I'm excited to say the least. Research the company. Be yourself. Dress appropriately.

"Jan 4, 2017",Anonymous Interview Candidate,Senior Business Consultant Interview,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"Two phone interviews over a 6 month span (they said the position had been put on hold). Standard behavioral questions. Then, 30 minutes into the 2nd interview she asks for my salary. As many folks, I've been counseled since college, bschool,etc to put off discussing salary until there's an offer for a whole host of reasons. And alright although I've met pushy recruiters over the years I had never encountered this: she insisted, insisted and insisted and when (after becoming totally put off) I declined, she ended the interview and said without a salary she would mark the interview incomplete and refuse to share with the hiring manager, even though it had gone well. I told her I'd be happy to tell her if the range for the position was in my ballpark... she said this ""company does not disclose salary ranges"" (i thought, well, neither does this candidate...). I offered other hints/help such as how my experience was a few years ahead of the job spec, or that I previously reported to a higher level position than this one would report into, etc. No matter. If I did not give her a number she would refuse to continue the process. Why? To avoid wasting each other's time, she said. Ok, then why did you interview me for 30 minutes before asking? Or why didn't you ask me the first time when we had spoken for another 30 or 45 minutes?

Anyway, after this ridiculous back and forth I was completely turned off and just wanted to erase the last 30 minutes of my life so I said thanks but this might not be a fit (plus when she mentioned the thing about wasting time she said something like ""if salary was 65k and you're at 120 it makes no sense"" so I felt like we were almost certainly not in the same neighborhood).

If that is really the company's policy, it's sad. Luckily some states are starting to pass legislation against practices like this in interviews, but too little too late in this case.

I think she was a contract recruiter but still... Terrible impression of the company.",Application,What analytical programs/software do you use? Â  Answer Question

Yesterday afternoon she left me a message telling me that everything cleared and that I am ready for my face to face interview. But here is the kicker. She told me to get back to her asap so we can schedule an interview. I call her and leave a message and send her an email regarding available times for me to come in.

She leaves me an email the next day telling me, at 11:49am that I don't get get back to her by 2pm that same day, she will move on to other candidates.
I mean, what? What was the big rush? She told me that the next interview date was on the 14th, 7 days away. I have never worked with an employer who uses these tactics. She wasted my time, I have responsibilities outside of applying for this job and Southwest proved to be inflexible.
