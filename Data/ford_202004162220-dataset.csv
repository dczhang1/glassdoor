"Feb 21, 2020",Communications Manager Interview,"Anonymous Interview Candidate in Dearborn, MI",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 5+ months. I interviewed at Ford Motor Company (Dearborn, MI) in February 2020.","I was initially contacted by a recruiter on the Ford Talent Acquisition team, and was asked to apply for the position online. Several MONTHS went by before hearing anything more, despite my repeated inquiries for a status update (I have experienced this ""radio silence"" several times in dealing with Ford). I was eventually told the position had been ""put on hold,"" but was re-opened and the hiring managers wanted to speak with me. It took a couple of weeks to schedule an interview.
The interview was only 30 minutes long, and was scheduled with three Ford employees, one of which was the hiring manager. On the day of the interview, however, the hiring manager didn't even show up to the interview. When I asked about this, I was told the hiring manager had to attend a meeting with an executive.
I was asked some fairly generic questions by two employees who didn't seem to know much about me and who clearly didn't want to be there. The interview concluded after 30 minutes (which isn't enough time to get to know anyone, in my opinion). The recruiter emailed me two days later and informed me the company was no longer interested.
Overall, the process seemed to be unprofessional and disrespectful of my time and effort. The company didn't seem to be serious about filling this posted position.",Walk us through your resume. Â  1 Answer

"Feb 17, 2020",Product Designer Interview,"Anonymous Interview Candidate in Detroit, MI",No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at Ford Motor Company (Detroit, MI) in November 2019.","Overall, the interview process was lacking and in the end, disappointing. As a senior designer candidate, my first âinterviewâ was a more of a standard âtouch-baseâ with the internal recruiting coordinator where I was initially screened.

A few weeks later, my first official interview consisted of a video where I rapidly presented relevant work within a 45 minute timeframe. I could have done better had I been set up for success. I feel the internal recruiter suggested I prepare to show one thing while the team interviewing me were requesting items I had had, but not on-hand for the interview. Had I known, I would have included exactly what they were looking for. I left that interview feeling a little defeated as I couldnât show examples of exactly what they were wanting.

After about a week, I heard back and was asked to travel on-site for a panel interview. Ford flew me out, paid for food and lodging and took care of all shuttles to/from the site. The interview lasted right at an hour where I sat in a cubicle with three others discussing the role and answering questions. Some of the questions were specific to my role and experience and some were standard/traditional interview questions. Overall I left feeling like I interviewed well, had great answers to all questions and asked some good ones myself.

Along the entire process, I was good about sending my follow-up emails, expressing gratitude and excitement about the role. I heard at least three times that I would be told one way or another if I did or did not land the job. After a full month I checked in and was told it was both the holidays and the team was out of town but I should hear something the start of the year. After a full 6 weeks after interviewing, I officially recognized they werenât going to let me know either way. Iâm a little upset I didnât get the job but Iâm much more irritated that I never heard back one way or another, after being told I definitely would.

For a company the size of Ford and the amount of time all parties invested in interviewing me and flying me out to Detroit, Iâm a bit surprised and disappointed in the communication and lack of consideration. Not only was I not set up for success during my initial interview, they also didnât stand by their word and keep me informed of the specifics.",How do you deal with a challenging product owner or stakeholder that's insisting on a solution that might not be in the best interest of the product?

"Feb 11, 2020",Enterprise Agile Coach Interview,"Anonymous Interview Candidate in Dearborn, MI",No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied through a recruiter. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at Ford Motor Company (Dearborn, MI) in February 2020.","The first interview with an existing agile coach contractor went well. This is regarding a multiperson video interview (second round) with Agile Coaches in Ford Motor Company's Agile Transformation Office. The first Agile Coach showed up on Zoom on time, and while waiting for the second person we went through the normal background explanations. It was approximately twenty minutes into the video interview, that another Agile Coach came into the interview, by audio-only. To set the background, this interview, this role was about the Agile Transformation of new teams. This interview showed poor interviewing technique and discriminated against the interviewee. I'm not blaming Ford, I don't even believe they know what is going on in their Agile Transformation Office. Clearly the people there are not trained or capable to interview and be ethical.","To set the background, this interview, this role was about the Agile Transformation of new teams. The second coach on audio started out condescendingly stating ""You may have to write this down as you won't remember it""... Going on to verbally lay out a scenario of four teams and what would I do if given that scenario, to which I answered it. There was no response to my answer. Beingâ¦Â  condensending in an interview, shows poorly of the interviewer, and the firm they respresent. The issue here is not only could that coach not repeat that scenario again as he just made it up, that is discrimination against me the interviewee. No one else interviewing would recieve that question or be judged on that question. You just singled me out by doing that, that is discrimination. This coach then went on to ask about Program Predictability and how I would use that. The topic is transformation of new teams, why and I asked this, would you be asking about forcasting future program increments when the topic is teams, stating that I wouldn't be teaching or using that. There was no response, and actually the interview went quiet for a good thirty seconds. Â  1 AnswerShow More"

"May 8, 2019",Marketing Communications Manager Interview,"Anonymous Interview Candidate in Dearborn, MI",No Offer,Negative Experience,,"I applied online. The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at Ford Motor Company (Dearborn, MI) in February 2019.","Applied for the position online. Was contacted via email a few weeks later by an HR representative who requested to set up a time to gather more information. We agreed on a date and time to discuss my background, but when the date/time came, no phone call. On my ride home later that day, I receive a phone call from the representative, asking me if it was still a good time to speak. I explained that I was prepared several hours earlier (at the agreed upon time), but was currently driving. The rep insisted that it would be quick and simple, so [not wanting to miss the opportunity] I agreed to discuss during my commute home. Several days later I received an email prompting me to select a good date/time for an onsite interview.

Once candidates check-in for the onsite interview, they are escorted to a large conference room where a short introductory video is shown, explaining company culture, benefits, etc. Candidates are then ushered to panel interviews for their individual positions. All candidates are offered the option to take the factory tour afterwards.

I felt as though my interview went strongly - background experiences matched up well, shared my vision for the position, etc. When asking about 'next steps', the two Ford employees seemed very enthusiastic and let it be known that they would be reaching out to me sometime within the next 7 business days. Two weeks go bye, and I receive an automatically generated email from Ford stating that after careful review, they've decided to cancel the position entirely. No explanation, no personal contact from anyone who I had spoken to throughout the process, and no recommendations for other positions that may interest me.

Positions at Ford are highly competitive, and I could certainly understand if I did not receive an offer because another candidate was more qualified. But one would think that after wasting my personal time - as well as the time of other candidates - having to make multiple arrangements with current employers for the multiple rounds of interviews, only to cancel the position, they'd be willing to offer more than a blanket email that was void of an explanation of any substance.

I interviewed at Ford Motor Company (Sunrise, FL) in January 2019.","Overall the interview process was good, they are very organized, timely, professional, and friendly. The following is my experience,

The interview process is divided into three phases:
1. A screening phone interview
2. A second phone interview with staff
3. An on-site panel interview

(1) In the phone screen you'll be asked factual questions like years of experience, background, GPA, expected salary, and so forth. Most importantly, you'll be asked about what experience you have pertaining to the position. Be prepared to mention specific projects, tools, and methods you used.

(2) Following a positive phone screen, you may be scheduled for another phone interview within a week or two; this time with a hiring manager and a technical engineer.
All points in your resume may be covered, so be ready to describe each one intelligently (I suggest using the S.T.A.R. method). You will also be asked general questions about you, your career, job positions, and, near the end, if you have any questions for them.

(3) Following a positive phone interview, you may be scheduled for an on-site interview within a week or two; the hiring manager will be there along with several engineers.
The interview is 2-3 hours long, with about 20+ multi-part questions, each one taking a turn in asking you a question. The first half consists of behavioral questions and the second half technical questions pertaining to the role.
Be prepared to talk about several unique projects and examples from your experience. Keep your answers brief, precise, relevant, and honest. Conveniently, each sub-part of each question seems to align with the STAR method of responding.
(4) From here their final decision will follow within a few weeks.

Phone interview
2 online tests
Assessment centre (group exercise, role play, interview, software test)

It was all very easy, however a huge problem with the assessment centre:

The software test was very simple, too simple and it counted for nothing.
The role play was rather uncomfortable as you had to read around 10 sheets of information in 15 minutes and then had to act as an employee convincing another employee (actor) of going along with a business proposition. I'm a great software engineer, but NOT a good actor and kept breaking character.
The group exercise has its faults as there will be 1 or 2 people who dominate the conversation. Thats not actually meant to be a good thing, but I'd bet my house that the guy who dominated my group exercise got hired. It was all box ticking and unfortunately no human element was involved.

TLDR; speak the most and loudest in group exercise, be good at acting and be able to retain opious amounts of information. Doesn't matter how good of a software engineer you are at all, you could of literally pretended to be one and still got the job.","Questions were situational, competency based, team work, etc Â  Answer Question"

I received a response from an internal recruiter within a week. Here's where things had begun to take a turn for the worst. The initial screening was your typical ""HR grilling"" about your background and if it lines up with the role. My experience was a year off from the requirement and there was another requirement that they were willing to work with me on. Personally, this requirement was necessary to succeed in the role as I had the necessary domain experience. But this recruiter was petty and rejected me because I had a year less than the stated requirement in the job description. My issue was that before you contact a candidate you should already know if they have enough experience or not. This shouldn't be hard to grasp from an individual's resume. Rejecting me over something that is clearly shown in my resume is an utter waste of time, period. After I was given the bad news that I wouldn't be able to move forward in the process I altered them to another posting that was more up my alley. They agreed that I'd be a good fit for that role as well so they contacted their colleague and forwarded over my information. A week later I followed up on the new position that I made them aware of and the response that I got was weird. The recruiter acted as if they didn't know what I was talking about and said that I was still unable to advance. Basically, this person didn't keep their word about passing my information along.
