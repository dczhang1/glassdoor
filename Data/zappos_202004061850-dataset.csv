"Mar 17, 2020",Anonymous Interview Candidate,Android Developer Interview,Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at The Zappos Family.,"General process: I applied around January and received a difficult but very interesting technical challenge to do within a week. Then 8 online self-recording video questions. Then an introduction call. Then more final round interviews.

Experience: The entire process is slow and well beyond 2 months. Around the end of the process, I have offer deadlines and I reached out to the HR several times asking for an expedited process or maybe just an answer is fine. However, HR ignored my emails for days and then proceeded to send me a mass email saying that I entered the final stage.

"Jan 17, 2019",Anonymous Interview Candidate,Human Resources Interview,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. The process took 3+ months. I interviewed at The Zappos Family in November 2018.,"Started with an initial call with the recruiter, who was very friendly. The next step was to speak with a member of the team, one of the HR Business Partners. The HRBP was nice as well, though she sounded a bit rushed. Afterwards, over the next two months I would occasionally check in with the recruiter since I never heard back regarding the interview, asking if she had an update from the interviewer and letting her know by the second month that I was progressing in the interview process with other companies. She would apologize for the delay and let me know she was going to find out right away what next steps would be. I then wouldn't hear back. By the third month I assumed nothing was going to happen.

"Dec 29, 2018","Anonymous Employee in Las Vegas, NV",Accounting Interview,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied through college or university. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in November 2018.","This will be fairly long but should cover the whole process for an accounting intern, for other internships things will probably be a little different. The process was pretty simple. It started with e-mailng your resume to the college recruiter. They will then send an e-mail with the link to the virtual interview and you'll have about a week to complete it. With an accounting internship there is no need for a cover letter video. After the video interview they invite you to the on-campus interviews. It is a full day of around 30 minute interviews, lunch with the other interviewees and interviewers, and lastly the hour long culture interview. The interviews aren't difficult but they will want to see your personality. My advice is to be friendly with not just the interviewers but also the other people who want the internship. Talk with them during lunch and try to make a good impression. Most questions on the video interview are pretty out there as most people expect of Zappos, but the in person interviews were a lot more simple and revolved around the contents of your resume, values, personality, and your knowledge of accounting. They will ask accounting questions but they are pretty basic. For the culture interview, the questions are again pretty standard, there will be a lot of time for you to ask questions. Make them personal and fun also find something interesting about yourself that will make you stand out so you can mention it. If you have any accounting questions do not ask the recruiter since they are not very familiar with the accounting department. Instead ask the more general questions. The biggest advice I have is to be yourself. You don't have to be super quirky. Just be yourself and you'll probably stand out more than the people who are trying to fit Zappos' ""culture"". If they like you they will send you an e-mail with an offer. Then you will receive a background check e-mail to complete . Once that is passed they will send you an official offer which you will sing online and then you will receive all of the information needed for your first day.",What is the difference between depreciation and amortization?

"Mar 2, 2016","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Las Vegas, NV",Business Analyst Interview,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"The process took 4 weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV).","The first part was pretty standard, asked for your resume, cover letter, and a short essay question on why you decided on zappos. They also asked for an optional video cover letter (which I included). I received an email immediately. In the email they gave me one week to complete a case study and a virtual interview. In the case study they give you a situation and 3 questions asking what you'd do etc. In the virtual interview, it consisted on 9 questions, 3 of the questions were business related and the rest were all questions aimed toward determining your personality.","If you were on a deserted island, what's 2 things you would bring?

I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in March 2016.","The interview process was horrifically long. My recruiters were non-responsive throughout the process and when I finally got to the onsite stage of the interview, it took 4 months (and constant back and forths) for me to be reimbursed for my interview. Even for the results, I had to constantly ask the recruiter for updates. When I found out I was invited onsite, Zappos rushed me to complete my interview in the next few weeks, but they seemed to take their time when it comes to getting back to me with the results (almost 2 weeks, which was quite unusual for a tech company). They were very irresponsible and simple didn't care about recruiting. The recruiters refuse to pay for meals and check every receipt carefully and ask questions on every transaction that was made. Zappos is an extremely cheap company and would inquire even about transactions with $1. I didn't accept their offer and honestly, its not worth it to work for such a cheap and irresponsible company.","Dynamic Programming, Recursive Search Â  Answer Question"

"Apr 1, 2016",Anonymous Interview Candidate,Full Stack Engineer Interview,No Offer,Negative Experience,Average Interview,I applied online. I interviewed at The Zappos Family in March 2016.,"I applied online, and I received a jobvite email. There is no email address or phone number. I think this could be auto generated. The main thing from HR email was Hacker Rank test. HR email mentioned that the expectation was not to finish the test, and the test was one hour. It was kind of strange. I have taken Hacker Rank test before. Hacker Rank is not easy to program in. I don't recommend it as running customized test cases seem slow. And the first time I used it, I had to spend a lot of time getting familiar with the interface.

I tried the test. I finished one question in about 20 minutes. Then I tried another programming question. This one took a while. One of the test cases had the wrong answer. It should be 7 instead of 8. And the answer was in the description of the problem. Whoever wrote the test case did not read the description. I wrote in the comment that this test case had wrong answer. I was thinking maybe they would talk to me if they read this, but no one acknowledged that. I don't think anyone read this code.
Then I started on another programming question, and I ran out of time and just submitted. Two weeks later, I received a reply from HR about my challenge review. From college, eight CS questions, I usually have more than 4 hours from my professors at NorCal (renowned public school). I think I did ok given the time, but of course I had no idea what zappos was about as the whole process seemed pretty mysterious. And maybe zappos is run by a bunch of robots. :)

Things observed:
1. Jobvite generated email (maybe auto generated)
2. No email address or phone number in all the emails (is this real?)
3. HR didn't talk to you on the phone (robots?)
4. 8 questions in an hour
5. Test case had wrong output with different answer from the description (commented on this in the code)
6. Robots read the code, robots write emails, and it was difficult to talk to robots so far. :p",Find the largest and positive? difference comparing two numbers sequentially in a series of numbers?? (May not be exactly this) Â  1 Answer

After you have applied, you have to give a test on Hackerrank and also a virtual interview. My Hackerrank test had 3-4 questions, standard questions (nothing too tough), but you should be prepared well. Virtual interview asks about 4-6 behavioral questions and probably 2-3 very basic technical questions. (OOPs concepts, GET vs. POST etc) .

The On-site process is so muuuch fun! The people at Zappos, especially the recruiters, make sure you're comfortable and try to connect you with potential future team members. On-site process involves another coding round, an HR interview, and finally a whiteboard coding technical interview.

Coding interview - Techies at Zappos give you a problem and you have to code the solution.

HR interview has another set of behavioral questions lined up for you. (some are pretty tough, nevertheless, my advice to anyone is that ""just be yourself"", if you happen to be in that situation.)

Technical interview is easy, they ask you basic algorithmic questions ( I was asked questions from topics like string operations and hashmaps.

I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in September 2015.","I submitted my resume and filled out the online application on zappos.com. The head of recruiting emailed me to tell me that I had survived the first internal screen. After the second internal review, the head of recruiting contacted me to set up a phone interview. After that, I did a phone interview with the hiring manager and one person from the department (a/k/a/ Holocracy Circle). Since this is an executive position (a/k/a Holocracy Circle Lead), Amazon needed to have a phone interview with me next. I spoke with an Amazon recruiter and went no further in the process. I'll address that experience in a separate comment under Amazon.

Zappos does a great job of keeping people informed throughout the process. They definitely are focused on providing the same level of customer service during the hiring process that they do to customers who order. This effort to treat job candidates with respect is all too rare in my experience.

They were unsuccessful in hiring for this position and have recently reposted it. I wonder if there is a person who could satisfy both Amazon and Zappos in this process.","On a scale of 1 to 10, how weird are you? Â  1 Answer"

If you don't put Customer Loyalty Team as a choice, you will be waiting a long time for contact as that seems to be the real starting point.They have various ""mixer"" events while you wait where you can meet staff and they can meet you. Seems like a good idea, but if you start asking the ""wrong"" types of questions like ""What do you think of the new managerial style Zappos has added?"" You get evasive, nervous answers. I saw one ""team member"" actually look around to see who was nearby before giving a noncommittal answer. 1984? or KGB about?

If selected, you do an online song and dance with multiple testings of typing, grammar, and video interview. Very easy. Next you are asked to set up an interview, which in my case I had to email 3 times to get my recruiter to set a date. Interview day took about 5 hours as there were many, many candidates. Finally got a 2 on 1 interview with HR. Asked scenario and basic other questions. The people were nice, but seemed preprogrammed on what they wanted to hear.

Don't worry about your skills, education, background, experiences as none of it matters. They are more interested in who ""fits"" in their clubhouse. They ignore many wonderful people who would be a great asset to their company based on a short interview and opinion of the H.R. team. The pay offered is ridiculously low. ($11.00 an hour) but in fairness, you can increase it a tiny bit later on.

I liked Zappos. They seemed sincere, but lost in direction and focus on some very crucial aspects. They need to pay their people better, have better accountability, and get a more diverse work force rather than this overly narrow corporate culture. You need the strengths of both introverts and extroverts. Being (acting) upbeat all the time is not natural. Nothing is perfect and you should be able to state disagreements or flaws without fear of repercussions. I saw real fear in some of their employees if asked of real opinions.

"Aug 6, 2015","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Las Vegas, NV",Senior Financial Analyst Interview,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in April 2015.","I signed up for Zappos Insider since I heard the culture was fun/quirky/cool and I was really attracted to that. Initially, I submitted a resume and answered some basic background questions and some silly questions. The other reviews give a good overview of what the silly questions are so I don't need to repeat them here. I went to an Insider event which was very entertaining (and slightly awkward - like all networking events are!) Overall, I was glad I went because it gave me a really good flavor of the culture.

A few weeks later, I saw they were hiring for a Senior Financial Analyst (right up my alley) so I submitted my resume specifically for that position. A recruiter contacted me via email and asked me to fill out an online job application (a serious one) and arranged for me to take a 1-hour Excel challenge. You do this remotely and just have to email it back to them within an hour. It was very straightforward and included pivot tables, vlookup, and some basic math/analysis of a financial statement. I was notified via email that I passed the Excel test and it was time for my first phone interview with the recruiter.

The phone interview started off really well. She had basic questions for me about my background and capabilities. I was very enthusiastic and used every opportunity I had to work in how much I loved Zappos' values and culture and used examples of my actions from previous jobs to show how I would contribute positively to the culture (proactively organizing happy hours, weekend getaways with big groups of co-workers, how I turned one co-worker's weird personality quirk into a strength by training him to adapt it to his advantage). The conversation went well and flowed easily.

The recruiter said she wanted to bring me in to meet with the team - but - what were my salary requirements? So I told her what I made at my last job and - WOW - she said the salary for this job was 40% below that! I was flabbergasted. I had heard that Zappos pays below market and was willing to take a pay cut for this job, but that was just too much. The recruiter used a cost-of-living calculator (since I moved here from an expensive city) and was trying to sell me on how the salaries were actually equivalent because of the cheap housing cost and no income tax in Nevada. This may be true, but I am still early in my career and I didn't want to pin myself into a low salary, because I was afraid it would mean my future raises (usually given as % of current salary) would result in less money and that it would mean I couldn't earn as much in my next job either. I asked if there was room to negotiate and the recruiter flat out told me no because I was already at the highest end of the allowed range.

I was super bummed but declined the follow-up interview and kept looking and found a similar position for more than what I made at my last job! Money isn't everything.... but it has to be in the right range! I hope my experience helps somebody. :)",What do you know about Zappos already? Â  Answer Question

First they asked me to write a small application. That primarily involved to build some logic for identifying all the combinations satisfying a given condition, and had to use Rest Api along with downloading images.

Then there was a telephone interview for an hour. Questions were very simple and focused on object modelling, basic java and sql. They also asked me to explain about my project. Asked me to explain about any important decision I took in the project.

This was followed by an onsite interview. I was asked to travel to Vegas for the interview. They will plan your travel verywell.

Onsite interview was very long. It started at 8:30 am and went till 5pm. Frankly I felt it was very long with several rounds. But I believe the hiring process is one of best ones I ever had. I gives you sense what they r looking for and gives you an idea how people are at Zappos.

Here is how my whole day at Zappos went. For first one hour they gave the tour of the company, showed us different departments. It was quite useful to know work culture at the company.

After that I had four technical and one HR(behaviorial) rounds. In two rounds they asked me to write algorithms like reverse a linked list, tree traversing algorthms, permutation and combination algorthms. They asked additional questions like time complexity and write alternate algorithms. You may also have to discuss about performance of what you write.

Second one was coding challenge, they asked me to write code to implement Lift. They give you one hour of time and would expect you it to run.

"Apr 2, 2015",Anonymous Interview Candidate,CLT Interview,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family in March 2015.,"I joined the insiders on 2/17 and was contacted by 3/5 to apply for the position. On 3/7 I was sent an email to completed the Zappos Family Application, the Scheduling information questionnaire and then to do a video interview. The email detailed their pay structure, $11 to start and then $13 once trained and asked that you respond only if you are ok with that.
I think I did well with everything until I got to the video interview. Crashed and burned. I was very nervous to start with and then answered the first question incorrectly. I didn't realize until I was preparing for the second question - when that question came up I totally blanked and could not answer it. I knew I was done for and just wanted to finish. The first question was about good customer service I had received and why it was good. I didn't read it closely enough and gave an example of good service I had given. The second question was about their core values and I could not even think of just one. Understandably, I got an email the following week telling me I could reapply in 6 months. I believe I will be reapplying, if for no other reason than to prove to myself that I am worthy!

I liked the interview process. It was unlike anything I have ever experienced and I did enjoy the challenge.

I interviewed at The Zappos Family.,"I was very excited to go to the in person interview. After the phone interview I had with the team I felt fairly confident and excited. I thought we really clicked and they knew my skill set etc. However I knew things had gone bad fairly quickly. First they have you come very early to do a tour of the building and they talk up why it's so great there. If I'm being honestly and I am, this is hard because you are nervous and tired and it seems all very pointless. The tour could be cut in half. Then they put you into a room to start the interviews with people. For me personally after a couple rounds of interviews with some of the team (3 people) we (the team and I) all went to lunch together. At this point I thought it was going fairly well. Not too terrible but not badly either. I was pretty nervous so it was hard to read. But then I knew about ten mins into the lunch that I wouldn't get the job when the person that would of been my boss barely could make eye contact with me. He seemed irritated by everything I said which made me even more nervous. Then I knew the nail was in the coffin when we got back to the offices he seemed irritated that he had to find out where I needed to go next. When I left to go on to interview with someone else he didn't even shake my hand or acknowledge my presence. At that very second I knew the rest of the day would be a pointless exercise. I thought well I'll use this opportunity to practice my interview skills. The rest of the day was pretty bad. Knowing early on that I was absolutely no way going to get an offer I basically stopped trying at all. Sad but true. The other people I met with must of got the memo that I was already in the no pile. Most of them didn't even bother to look up from their laptops when they spoke to me.

Within a few days I got an e-mail informing me that the first step in the process was for me to take two different online assessments. One was a typing test. I think you only had to be able to type 20 wpm. The second test was a grammar assessment. Both were simple and straight forward. The day after I'd taken the tests I got another e-mail letting me know I'd passed. The next step was a face to face interview! I interviewed with two different ladies. One did the ""Culture"" interview and the other did the ""Technical"" interview. My culture interview was a normal kind of job interview with a few ""Zappos"" type of questions. That lasted about 45 minutes. I wold definitely say remember to do your homework on the company before you go! Then it was on to the technical interview. That took place in a small room with a computer. She would give me scenarios and then watch as I used the Zappos website (or google) to find what the customer was looking for. It seemed like they were just checking to make sure you had a general understanding of how to work the internet! :) She also asked me some ""What would you do"" type of questions related to helping an escalated customer call. (Like a family going on vacation who didn't get their new shoes in time). I have a few friends. Then my interview was over and I was told they would be deciding within the week. I left the interview and went to a movie. When I got out I had an e-mail telling me I'd made it to the next step. The position was mine as long as I passed their employment verification and background checks. That process took about one week. After that I got a call officially offering me the position!","Knowing what you know about Zappos Core Values, if you had to help me plan a fun themed event, what kind of event would it be?

"Sep 14, 2014","Anonymous Employee in Las Vegas, NV",CLT Interview,Accepted Offer,Positive Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 2 weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in August 2014.","After I created my account through the Zappos Insiders site, I was eventually contacted by my recruiter and from there it was actually pretty fluid and quick. Anytime I sent and email to my recruiter she generally responded really fast, which was a pleasant surprise compared to other jobs. From there, I was given the links to my skills test as well as me creating a video interview.

The video interview itself wasn't intimidating, there is a time limit and no chance on 'do-overs' but the point is more about creativity and being yourself versus a rehearsal. There was also the typing test which eventually led to me being sent the last few parts of the process which also included writing a letter to Tony on why you believed you should be hired. Personally, I adored their application questions and getting the chance to write out answers like 'My favorite Superhero and why?'-- overall I enjoyed each step.

Once I'd submitted everything and moved through each point, I had my in-person interview which included another skills test with the computer. I had never been to Zappos' HQ before and I was honestly very astonished with how friendly everyone was. I've worked at alot of huge employee filled placed, but non that had that warmth behind the greetings. Heck, even the other guy that was there for an interview at the same time as me was very friendly (Me and him both actually were taken on and we're in the same training class now, giving me a friend/coworker right off the bat.)

The interview was amazing, my recruiter was a joy to meet in person and not only did I address your average Interview questions, but we talked and joked around. It was more like having a talk with a new friend getting to know them than it was an actual interview. We were having such a good time we didn't realize how much we'd been running over before I was suppose to switch to the other employee who was doing the skills portion.

Next up, you interview with another person where you sit at the computer and take on mock call situations while navigating Zappos. It was the first I'd ever actually been put in that situation, but it was actually really cool to see them interested in gauging a person's ability and desire to empathize, navigate, and also accommodate the customer. After everything was said and done, I felt really good about it all and in all honest I had never had so much fun on an interview.

It only took a couple days before I heard back, the last parts being the need to run my background check. That all went smoothly and I was given my offer.

All and all, it was an awesome experience and I only wish more places tackled their recruiting process like Zappos.","If I was going to hold a parade, what would the theme be and why? Â  Answer Question"

Unable to fly down to interview, they immediately closed off my application abruptly.

"Jan 12, 2014","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Las Vegas, NV",Software Developer Interview,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in January 2014.","I applied in Zappos by vising their website and applying in jobvite. They asked me some cool questions in the form and I answered them. Then there was a dead silence for 2 months.

Out of the blue, suddenly I got an email that they want me to take a test. I gave the test. There was one question. Download images from their API and save them in your system. The trick was to do so in such a manner that it is deliverable to the customer. i.e. you have to follow all the guidelines and have to follow the OOP principles. I qualified that round.

Then they said that they want to interview me. The first round was HR round. We were scheduled for an hour talk. And we did. Boy that was fun. Best interview I ever had. The HR was impressed and I was impressed with him. After that interview I so wanted to join that company. I was thrilled.

Then I was contacted for another technical round. Two people were supposed to take my interview. Easy peasy. Now believe me, if they say that its not going to be any coding, only talking, don't believe them. In my interview they asked me to share a document and write codes there. But if you have done enough programming like me, it shouldn't be a problem. In the interview the guy asked me to ""reverse a sentence"". Very easy. I did that. But the mistake I did was (atleast what I think) is that I just wrote the code. You have to show them your thought process. So talk as much as you can. Explain why you did what you did. Show them more than one solution (or atleast tell them how you would do it). (The irony is that as soon as I kept the phone, suddenly I had these great alternatives that I could have told them which definitely would have made an impression. But alas, it was too late).
Then the guy started asking me some SQL questions. Questions were easy, using ""HAVING"", ""IN"", ""AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS"", and ""NESTED QUERIES"". Now I know SQL, but it had been a while since I wrote anything in SQL. So I couldn't answer them. And that was a disaster. He immediately said that he now knows what he needed to know and he wants to terminate the interview.

3-4 days later, I received the saddest email, saying I was not fit. Which is true. I should have read SQL. I just didn't because I focused more on OOP and algorithms. But I am happy that atleast I was the ""right cultural fit"" for them (which is an accomplishment in its own).

I will definitely try Zappos again. Its one of the few companies which knows what a company should be like. Their culture and values are awesome, which for a uptight person might seem ""unprofessional"", but actually helps in keeping control in office and satisfying employees. I salute the CEO, which is the best (based on what I have read about him).

If an employee is seeing this, I LOVE YOU ZAPPOS. Thank you for having the best interview experience I ever had (Even though I did not get it).","1. SQL questions. If I had any idea that they could have asked SQL, I would have brushed up my skills.
2. Why are you fit for our company ?
3. In the first written test, it took me 10-15 minutes just to figure out how to make API calls. It was my first time ^_^
4. Would you like to come ""hiking"", ""running"", ""drinking"" with me ? I answered yes, and actuallyâ¦Â  invited him to take me to ""bars"" and ""casinos"" and ""strip clubs"", because I had never been to one. To my surprise, he said yes.
PS: I was just testing them by my last question, whether they are as ""cool"" as they say they are. And my answer is they actually are. Â  Answer QuestionShow More"

"Nov 22, 2013",Anonymous Interview Candidate,IOS Engineer Interview,No Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,I applied online. The process took 3 weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family.,"I applied online through Jobvite after seeing the position in their website. The first communication I had with them involved me filling out basically the exact same application I filled out initially, but including some of the aforementioned culture fit questions. I was then given a screener questionnaire with some basic questions about iOS development. A week later, I spoke with another recruiter for the cultural fit interview. I felt it went pretty well - the recruiter felt many of my responses were 'awesome'... too many of them, frankly. We had a nice banter about both Zappos's events and culture as well as some analogous culture in my workplace. The emphasis during the cultural interview seemed to be to ensure that you were comfortable working in a very laid back, college-y kind of environment. There were no real curveball questions. The recruiter told me to expect to hear back from the technical team the following week.

I received an email two days later that I had been rejected as other candidates were a better match. I can't imagine what kind of culture fit they are looking for in a candidate â apparently someone with a disingenuously voracious level of enthusiasm. I understand the focus of Zappos to ensure new hires are a good culture fit to the company, but the emphasis placed on culture seemed to be far too high.",How would you design a spice rack for a blind person?

Round 1: The first round was writing a program to parse the JSON structure of the Zappos API get the item images and writing the images into a folder. I made sure the code followed all the standards, was well commented and looked neat.

Round 2: The second round was with the recruiting member and it was majorly a behavioral interview.

I prepared for the interview based on the 10 core values of Zappos and the interviewer seemed impressed with the research I have done.

Round 3: It was a technical interview. The position was for an entry level standard. But since I already had 4 years of experience, the interview process seemed easy. Mostly basic core java questions like what is static, what are the different types of access modifiers, what is the difference between abstract class and interface.

A week later I received a non-personal email asking me to fill out another questionnaire, which asked for information I had already submitted (and also contained on my resume), and many personal questions. When I finally reached the end, the website gave me an error and erased my progress. This same email also indicated they wished me to complete yet another survey, within a 48-hour time period.

With red-flags everywhere, the process demonstrated to me that this company did not value my time, nor take me seriously, so I abandoned the application.

Thankfully I 'quit' when I did, because the reviews here confirm everything I suspected. Apparently, I was barely 10% through their process & they treat the ""awesomeness"" of their company as compensation alone. I don't mean to sound cynical, but I've heard the sales pitch way too many times ""work your ass off for my awesome company, get paid in awesome-publicity!""

The initial application process involved the usual resume and cover letter as well as a simulated project where I was asked to map out how I would introduce a new product to Zappos' website. This was to test project management skills and critical thinking. Then I had to complete an automated interview where I was prompted with questions and answered using my webcam and microphone. It was a little weird talking to my computer, but nothing too bad.

They emailed me back a few weeks later to tell me that they were flying me out to the Las Vegas headquarters to see the company and interview as a finalist for the position. The recruiters were extremely helpful and helped take care of all of the logistics and costs of flying there and back.

The Zappos headquarters is out of this world cool. The first day was very relaxing and they didn't drill us with any interviewing. They welcomed all the potential interns and took us around the campus and introduced us to the Zappos family. I got to see all the different departments and witness the company firsthand.

The interviews themselves were two parts, a technical interview and a character interview. Zappos believes very strongly in maintaining its corporate culture and will disqualify someone if they fail the character interview even if they ace the technical interview. The TPM team was very accommodating and answered all my questions during the simulated project. the recruiter for the character interview was also very friendly and not at all aloof or adversarial.

I like helping people, definitely have the technical skills (over fifteen (15) years in accounting) and love fashion. Husband was just saying this morning to be me before I got their 'thanks but you just don't fit what we are looking for email' - that I would get tired of the college like atmosphere real quickly and it probably was not the best place for me in the long run.

"Feb 5, 2013",Anonymous Interview Candidate,Merchandising Assistant Interview,No Offer,Positive Experience,Difficult Interview,I applied online. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at The Zappos Family.,"I applied online back in November and was contacted for a video interview a few days after. That went well. Then I had a string of phone interviews, group phone interviews, etc. Each conversation was pleasant. I eventually was set to fly out with the company for an interview and a day or so later I was told they closed the requisition for the position but I was referred to their sister site for another position as a MA. I began phone interviews again...and eventually was asked to join them in person.

They paid for my travel and hotel and took me to lunch the next day (lunch was an interview). The interview was from 9 AM - 3:45 PM. I met with about 12-15 people. Honestly, everything seemed like a blur with a lot of the same questions being asked. You can definitely tell they are looking for consistency and if you would be a good fit within the company. Everyone was very friendly and everyone appeared to be happy to be there. Lots of smiles and kind words. I also took an assessment of my ability to navigate through the website, not hard at all. I was made to feel very comfortable. Overall, the entire process took about 2.5 months.

In terms of the actual offer presented to me, I was offered $13/hr with company paid benefits and food is free on site. This would be a great offer if I were recently out of college but for a twenty something it is not enough money to get by on, especially with no relocation assistance moving across country. I have legit bills form undergrad and graduate school, car note, etc. They definitely pay below the industry average especially when the MA is actually working as an Assistant Buyer. Money isn't everything but in this case it was a NO for me even if I were offered the position. I couldn't afford to take a huge risk for low pay and at an hourly rate.

I really have nothing bad to say. It's obviously very buddy buddy and you can see how maybe work ethic and merit could be overlooked if you're not BFF's with the right people. But it works for some. They all say they loved hanging out with each other after work etc.

I actually met an intern a few months back that worked here and she said work ethic wasn't valued and everyone was essentially playing a part to get by, partied all the time, kinda high school mentality, she said it wasn't a great fit for her...who knows? I can't speak to that aspect.

I wasn't offered the position and I can't say I'm too broken up about it to be honest. There's plenty of other opportunities but if you can get it and fit the specifics they are looking for you will be just fine.","What are your favorite curse words?

"Feb 1, 2013","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Las Vegas, NV",Technical Recruiter Interview,No Offer,Negative Experience,,"I applied online. The process took 4+ weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV).","Zappos had this position open on and off for 6-13 months. As an experienced recruiter and manager this piqued my curiosity. After all, if they have trouble getting a technical recruiter they are probably going to have problems getting technical people. I decided to evaluate their hiring process and determine if there were flaws that would prevent my success.

The answer was YES! I think Zappos has gotten lost in their ""coolness"" and forgotten the basics. Candidates have to have a similar experience as their customers!

Zappos started with something I like which is just a quick upload of a resume. There's nothing more frustrating than having to spend a long time on a formal application only to have it disappear in to the black hole. A week or two later I recieved two e-mails that expressed interest and asked me to fill out an application, questionaire and then do a video interview.

This is where they went astray. First and foremost if this is standard for every single job, it will explain why they can't find a recruiter and why they have even more difficulty getting technical people than an already challenging location for what they need.

It's the first of the year. I'm in recruiting. New jobs are out and I'm working 12+ hours a day and barely have time to try to get to the gym, eat and go home and sleep and do it again. I completed the application the same way I'm completing this review. Starting at 5:30AM while I'm drinking my coffee. Standard interview except 3 of those ridiculous questions that people think are sooooo progressive that come around every decade and are really just a demonstration that they don't have a grasp of the basics.

I will write the questions in the next section but let me say that every single one would indicate age and/or discriminate against over 40 workers. Seriously, how many over 40 people actually think of who their favorite superhero is? I'm more concerned about the US economy, foreign relations and how Obamacare is going to impact business and HR.

I finished the application anyway because after all, I'm evaluating them. I don't *need* a new job. I'm considering them.

The second e-mail I received asked me to complete a video interview. I found this interesting because their web site says it is option. Given that the only place I can do it is at work because I am home long enough to shower and leave and then come home and sleep I knew it was going to be some time until I could do it.... even though I had no intention. Why? Because video interviews are appropriate if you have an out of town candidate you have already phone interviewed and want to take them to the next step before paying travel costs. Outside of that, they might be using them to test technical skills but I can demonstrate those in another way. The bottom line is that video interviews lend themselves to younger people who generally look better on camera. This is just like receiving a CV from outside the US where a photo is on it. The first thing that happens in recruiting is we try to remove the photo and other personal information like marital status, age, number of children, etc.

So I stalled and waited to see if Zappos was going to be rigid on this process. They were.

Here's the rub. The questions lend themselves to younger people. Even your answers can. The videos lend themselves to younger people. In Zappos attemp to be hip and progressive, they have lost sight of the basics!

In addition, Zappos clearly isn't dealing with the reality of how job seekers behave. Those in demand aren't going to jump through a lot of hoops. They are simply going to say ""next"". Rigidity in a hiring process doesn't work.

I have to wonder if they know how to interview or if it would be a google-style interview which seems hip but is so 1990s!

Bottom line - too much focus on cool and hip and not enough focus on the basics. Potentially discriminatory process and deep pockets (especially now that they are part of Amazon)

Little probability of success for a Technical recruiter so I wouldn't accept the position if offered unless I ran the place and could change the process!","There weren't any difficult or unexpected questions but I was asked:
""If you walked into a room and your theme song was playing, what would it be an why?"" I called a friend because I'm not into music most people are in to and she pointed out that the songs I like would date me (and I like music before my time too!). She suggested a song and I listened onlineâ¦Â  and yes, the lyrics described me.

If you could have lunch with two people current or in the past, who would they be and why? OK, so this one doesn't necessary reflect age but since I picked to people from the past and had a salient reason why and how that was tied to what I do, I didn't mind but I did pick historical figures that younger people don't learn much about any more (unless they major in US history!)

""If you could be a superhero who and why"" Really? Superhero? What am I, a 10-year old? <sigh> OK, google superheroes and figure it out.

Zappos... these interview questions started in the early 90s. They were abandoned as useless and potentially discriminatory. You may be ""hip"" but you clearly do not have a well balanced staff because anyone with any level of experience would roll their eyes and thing ""not this again"".

I wonder what it looks like inside of Zappos outside the call center. It's my guess that their average age is around 30-32, if that,. Â  Answer QuestionShow More"

I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Henderson, NV) in February 2013.","I have seen this position open multiple times over the last 18 months (it's now 8/12/13) so you know something is definitely wrong with a company not being able to ""find"" a candidate that clicks with the team.

I agree as another poster that a labor attorney could prove they are discriminatory in nature and place zappos at legal risk. Be prepared to put a lot into the process as a candidate nothing in return. I think they forget candidates are interviewing them as much as they are looking for employees.

-Invited to do a video interview. This is an automatic interview where you are given 5 questions and have 20 seconds to think before speaking to yourself on the camera. I personally hated this and think it is a bit of a rude way to interview people.
-Then was invited for a phone interview with a few hiring managers
-Then was invited to have an interview with a recruiter.

Overall I used to love zappos and was very excited to be given the opportunity to interview for a position at Zappos. Have said that, I did a TON of research on the company and alot of what I read, I was not Impressed with! I read stories that if you do not hang out with people outside of work, you can get fired! The pay is also terrible. They offer hourly pay and the $14 per hour is a joke! I was making that in high school and as an MBA holder, this is a joke!!!

- They also talk about on their blogs and in the zappos book that they encourage growth and promotions from within and try to aim for one every 6 month, however I was told point blank that It would be ATLEAST 3+ years before any promotion and was dismissed when I asked what the growth opportunities are within the position!

Zappos really cares about hiring people that fit their company culture. Before the interview, I had to take two kinds of behavior/culture screening tests.

Afterwards, I spoke over webcam with a really nice HR representative. The conversation was really laid-back. Basically just a run-through of work-experience, behavioral questions, and what-not. This is a culture screening interview.

I passed this stage and went on to be interviewed by the manager who would be my boss if I got hired. He seemed half-asleep when interviewing me. His web-cam was tilted awkwardly so I could't really see his face clearly. He looked like he was about to doze off...even before the interview actually began.

I asked a lot of specific questions about the job at the end. He then told me that the fact that I went to X university, didn't guarantee that I would get the job, which was kind of awkward. I thought I did a good job, but didn't get the job. Not exactly sure why...

The process took 7+ weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in November 2012.","My interview process began at my school's career fair. The recruiter scheduled an in-person interview for the next day. I will consider that to be round 1. The night of the career fair, I was asked to fill out an exhaustive online questionaire. It asked questions like, ""If you had a superpower, what would it be?"". From this survey, I got the sense that Zappos is looking for a certain, quirky type of personality.

Having passed the behavioral the next day, I moved on to round 2, which required me to make a short introductory video of myself, and a series of short videos answering various technical questions. I did not feel that this provided a good assessment of technical skill, since I (and every other candidate) had unlimited time to google the answers to the questions.

This led to round 3, which was a live technical interview with a panel of 3 engineers via webcam. This interview was part coding part java trivia. Finally, round 4 was a cultural interview with a young recruiter.

I appreciate Zappos' commitment to preserving a unique company culture. I have a feeling that I was not chosen for the internship for this very reason, but I believe in their effort.

I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in June 2012.","Applied for the job in the beginning of May and was not contacted until 3 and a half weeks later via email. I was instructed to fill out a ""formal"" application as well as a questionnaire then to complete a small skills test. The test involved a few grammar questions and a section to assess your typing abilities. I passed everything with flying colors and was scheduled a 30 minute phone interview. The interviewer that contacted me was very pleasant. She asked typical interview questions: ""why do you want to work for Zappos"" etc. She also asked ""After doing some research on our company, what have you learned."" (My advice to any attempting to apply for Zappos, DO YOUR RESEARCH ON THE COMPANY. Read up on them and watch the youtube videos about them. Learn as much as you can because this question will be asked more than once.)

The phone interview went extremely well. I was told that out of the other candidates, I was the ""only exciting one"" and that I ""wow'ed"" the interviewer. Ecstatic, I went ahead and made the soonest appointment to come in to take yet another test. I was instructed to come to the Zappos office where I was tested on my attention to detail. With a group of 5 other candidates, we were taken to a small section of the main office where there were computers set up on a mock zappos website. We were required to place 8 orders for fictional customers who all had odd names and information. (You only get to mess up 2 in order to pass) Once again, I passed the test with 100% and scheduled yet ANOTHER interview.

The email I was sent stated that I would be required to go through another series of tests to see how well I can navigate through search engines etc. I arrived to my interview early and was told by another candidate that the computer system used for the tests were down and that all she had to do were the face to face interviews. It didn't take long for me to be taken to my first one on one interview which was with one of the CLT leads. She asked basic interview questions, asked about my previous jobs, what are some accomplishments I'm proud of, and also gave me two customer scenarios and asked how I would handle each one. This lasted for 30-40 minutes and it was the most comfortable interview I've been to yet. It felt as if I were chit chatting with a friend. I asked a ton of questions at the end and was extremely thrilled at how well things were going. I was then taken to a different room for my next face to face interview which was with one of the recruiting managers. I should have known based on this interview that I was not going to land the job.

The woman that interviewed me seemed to only be interested in the emails she was receiving on her laptop rather than the answers to my questions. (both interviewers entered in my answers to their ipad/laptop) She barely made any eye contact and was not as animated as the previous interviewer. The emails she received were completely irrelevant to work as well! (she read one to me) Once again, I was asked typical questions: ""why are you looking for a new job"", ""what is an example where you went more than what was required of you"", and the infamous ""what do you know about Zappos"" etc. I answered all the questions with confidence and proceeded to ask when I should expect to hear from them. I was told I should hear back by Wednesday (interview was on a Sunday). A friend of mine who had an interview just an hour after mine told me he heard back hours after his interview and was given his start date! Patiently I waited and by Tuesday afternoon heard nothing back. Being impatient as I am, I emailed one of the recruiters to follow up and was sent a reply from the interviewer who seemed more interested in personal things than the interview itself. I was unfortunately told that against other candidates I was not a ""strong enough match"". I passed all their tests with ease, all the interviews went extremely well (so I thought), I have over 7 years of customer experience, yet I'm not a ""strong"" enough match to be in customer loyalty? I feel as though they base the hiring off your personality/looks rather than your skills. Walking through the Zappos office, I felt at home. The people were friendly and I felt as if my personality would fit perfectly. Apparently, someone didn't think so.

For those attempting to join the company, be warned.

A few days later I was contacted by HR to complete a profile and application on jobvite and after that was asked to do a personality assessment. A few weeks later I was asked to complete a 1 hour skills assessment in Excel. The recruiter emailed me a spreadsheet with 10 inputs and asked to model a 5 year income statement.

Then a cash flows statement, net sales per sq ft and finally net present value (NPV). So definitely brush up on your Accounting 1&2. The second part of the excel test is a data test where I was asked to do a vlookup and create a pivot table. I did well enough on the skills assessment so my HR recruiter called me to talk a little bit about myself. It was a 15 minute phone conversation covering some details about my resume and she asked me some questions about why I was interested to work for Zappos.

"Feb 24, 2012","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Henderson, NV",Android Engineer Interview,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 2+ months. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Henderson, NV) in January 2012.","I didn't have a lot of experience working with Android, but some and was interested in the Zappos interview process since I had heard so much about it. I'm currently employed so it was no stress to interview and see where it went. I guess I'm kind of a serial interviewee because I enjoy interviewing for different jobs. I've turned down a lot because I wasn't necessarily interested in actually working there but wanted to improve on interviewing.

Here's how it went for me:

1. Applied online
2. Got an email from a Tech HR Recruiter (like most of the big silicon valley companies they use contract tech recruiters).
3. Had a phone interview with the recruiter setup.
4. Did a personality or as Zappos calls it culture interview to see if I was a good culture fit. Passed with flying colors.
5. About a day later spoke to an assistant who wanted to setup a technical interview with the team on the phone the next day.
6. Did the technical interview with the team on the phone. I let them know at that time that I wasn't an expert at java or android, but that I had done some development in it.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â - They asked all of the typical questions, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Big O Notation, etc. etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â - Also asked Android specific questions, Activites, Intents, Data objects, Concepts, Layout, 9-patch etc.
7. I felt that the interview went ok, but that they could clearly see I was willing to learn but not an expert.
8. I didn't hear anything for 5 days and then I got an email indicating they were going to do some more interviews over the next couple of weeks and then get back to me. Which made me think hmm why not just tell me I wasn't experienced enough in Android and Java at that point? I reflected on it but it wasn't a big deal because it's just something that I added to the experience. Each interview process is unique in it's own ways.
9. So 2 weeks later exactly I got another email stating they wanted me to do a coding challenge. I won't spoil it for people still in the interview process. Its a pretty straight forward code challenge.
10. You have 2 hours to complete the coding challenge, the end result being an actual app.
11. I used existing code and modified it. Meh could have definitely done better if I had actually stayed up to date with android and the changing API. I did more when it was 1.5 1.6 and G1 days.
12. 2 weeks pass and I get another email that the team has reviewed my submission and they would like to have a coding review call the next week.
13. Week passes and then the coding review call occurs. Asking questions about issues I had, areas of code they were curious about, why some methods were public and not private, why I didn't use ProGuard never used the tool but now I know :). Overall I got the impression that yes, what I had submitted in the 2 hour timeframe really wasn't that impressive.
14. Still looks like the job is posted on their site, so dunno if they have hired someone yet.

Overall I really enjoyed the zappos interview process, at least as far as I got :). Definitely a fun process and nice people throughout!",What is your favorite superhero Â  1 Answer

I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Shepherdsville, KY) in January 2012.","I participated in the speed interview process for the photographer assistant position, and I actually really enjoyed it. I believe there were four interviewers and four interviewees. We spoke with each interviewer for five minutes and a bell would ring and we'd go to the next one. Each interviewer had a different categories/set of questions. This was clearly to see how you interact with different types of personalities. I really liked everyone I interviewed with, and I really enjoyed the company culture. I felt totally comfortable and confident about my interview, so I was surprised and disappointed when they contacted me a few days later to say I didn't get it, without offering a reason. Having said that, even though I didn't get the job, it was one of the best interview experiences I've ever had and I wish it could have lasted longer than 20 minutes.

A few things of note: I originally applied for this position in September of 2011. They didn't reply until November of 2011. In December, they had me fill out a long form application and take a personality test. I didn't interview until January of 2012.

"Dec 9, 2011","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Henderson, NV",Human Resources Interview,No Offer,Positive Experience,Average Interview,"I applied online. The process took 2+ weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Henderson, NV) in October 2011.","I applied online and received an e-mail through Jobvite to schedule a phone interview. The recruiter was fantastic: friendly, engaging. I had no doubt my experience would be ideal, but - a word of advice - read on the company, its culture and core values. There are a lot of videos on YouTube to help as well. Anyway, since I'm very non-corporate, geeky, prankster, joker and down-to-earth, I'd figure it would be the kind of culture I'd thrive in.

A few days after the phone interview, I got an e-mail asking to schedule a sandbox test, which is used to determine your attention to detail. Only up to 2 mistakes are allowed in a 30-minute span, but if you are careful and detailed it will be an easy task.

Then, I was invited to interview in person at its HQs. As per the interview invitation and the corporate culture, I didn't dress up for the interview, but I was wearing clean and average business casual clothing. A shuttle picked me up at the hotel by 9:30 a.m. and took me to the HQs. After waiting a bit and being provided water by the very nice guy at the front concierge desk, I was taken to a themed conference room. Soon, the recruiter with whom I had the phone interview and a more senior person came in and we talked about my specific experience as it relates to the position. I think everything went well and I clicked with the interviewers - I think they clicked with me as well. We spoke for approximately 40-45 minutes.

Then, they left and a couple of other people in the department came in. The questions were of the 'cultural fit' mode. We joked and laughed a lot. It was very informal and I got to showcase a bit of my joking personality. This was another 40 minutes or so. By then, it was time for lunch with various potential coworkers.

They took me to a nearby restaurant and I tried to have a conversation with all the people present (about 12-14 people), asking questions and laughing along, trying to be congenial and collegial.

After lunch, I had a further interview with yet another senior representative and it was a very pleasant informal chat that, again, lasted 40-45 minutes.

At the end, a friendly person took me around for a tour. I felt at home at Zappos - no doubt. I felt the zany and creative air would be the perfect place for me and I would be able to succeed and be a constructive member of the team.

Then, the waiting game began. Unfortunately, a week to the day of the interview I got an e-mail that said something along the lines that a majority of the team didn't click with me and therefore they would not pursue my application, that it was a very tough decision after some prolonged deliberations, etc.

I got the impression that the people I spoke with during the 3 separate interviews were not the issue. The problem was at lunch with the rest of the people. But I question whether it's realistic to 'click' or not with someone at lunch over a period of one hour. I've always had lunch with a prospective hire, but I would never judge his/her suitability simply by what happened at lunch. Moreover, it's hard to 'click' with 10-12 different people.

That was a bit disappointing. However, I know who and what I am and I know full well I'd be great in a culture such as Zappo's. There's not one thing I'd change about my interview and I have nothing but kind words for the people I had the pleasure of meeting. Their loss, not mine!","On a scale from 0 to 10, how lucky are you?

"Aug 25, 2011","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Las Vegas, NV",Customer Loyalty Team Interview,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Difficult Interview,"I applied through an employee referral. The process took 5+ months. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Las Vegas, NV) in August 2011.","After 5 months of various testing at home & on-site & passing all of those with flying colors, I anxiously awaited the e-mail to notify me of my face to face interview! Alas, an e-mail did arrive a few weeks later to inform me that due to the amount of applicants waiting for an interview, I would instead be scheduled for a phone interview with a Recruiter. I was contacted about a week later to set up a time & we agreed on that.

The day came for the interview & much to my surprise, the call came a full hour earlier than expected. As to take advantage & not try to reschedule, I hurried to get to a quiet place to gather pen & paper to take notes. The Recruiter said that he had ""finished some things early & figured"" he would call early & hope I was home. (bad sign #1) No sweat, gathered my thoughts quickly & was ready to interview. I was told originally the interview would last about 30 min., the Recruiter informed me 2 seconds into the call that ""this will be quick & shouldn't take more than 20 minutes. (bad sign #2). So, I was all set to answer questions about my resume & work history & then have some fun by seeing what ""crazy"" question he would ask (as I had seen in other reviews written)...WELL. I was then informed by the Recruiter that he was ""unable to open my resume"" (bad sign #3) which caught me off guard (since the resume had been in Jobvite since day 1 & everybody else had no problem opening it) as he had a full hour before our interview so why would he not have had that issue resolved BEFORE calling? In other words, no resume means he had no intention of knowing who he was interviewing, nor my experience, which only compounded the fact that he couldn't have seemed less interested in our conversation & sounded as if he had already decided on his choices for the position & was just trying to rush through the rest of the scheduled interviews. No funny anecdotes, no witty questions, no personality & no interest in anything besides rushing through a phone interview on a Friday afternoon. I've had more questions asked by Telemarketers.

I can not fault an entire company for one unfair interview, as everyone else I dealt with along the way was a pleasure. I do believe that I did not have a fair shot at a face to face interview & after 5 long months of having nothing but e-mails full of praise for passing tests & challenges, everything came down to 1 man who was not prepared enough to have even viewed the resume of a potential candidate, who never even intended to give me a chance. Am I weird? yes. Am I a ""Culture Fit""?. yes. Is my schedule completely open to any hours & days? yes. Do I have transportation? yes, Do I have 20 years of excellent customer service experience? yes. Have I previously been a Call Center Manager? yes.
All of these questions & more could have been asked during this 15 (yes, 15, not even 20!) minute conversation.
I will continue to apply for Zappos every chance possible because I can positively excel in this position. I also know it was just an unlucky draw of the cards that this man was chosen to ""interview"" (I say that loosely!) me. And because I do my own research, it was nice to see he has a public profile on Facebook & an entry posted 2 days prior to my ""interview"" at 9am saying that he was ""headed into work now to kick back with a beer & read some resumes"". Yes, this is Las Vegas, but I really thought there would be a more professional standard when it comes to determining someone's future employment.

Good luck to everyone else & stay positive through all the lengthy waiting periods (you may get one of the other awesome folks in HR who had been my contacts up until ""the end"") & hope you get a chance at a face to face interview. 99.9% positive i'd have moved onto one if I had gotten a fair shot!","None, only asked about past job.

That was followed with several online skills tests, for grammar and typing speed. After that, was a skills test for placing orders accurately on the zappos.com website. That was followed with a phone interview with HR, which seemed a mix of personality and general skills questions. Then, there was a phone interview with the hiring manager, which was the same themed questions, a mix of personality and skills-based questions.

This was a very long, drawn out process. I knew that they are careful in regards to whom they hire, as they hire based on personality fit, as well as skills fit. Each step of the interview process happened on a weekly basis, usually after I emailed my HR contact, asking for progress reports on my application. I would ask then get a reply saying that things were progressing. The final phone interview was on a Friday morning, but I found out that they had made a hiring decision, indirectly, via the Zappos page on LinkedIn.com, 2 days after my interview.

This meant that they had interviewed me, then made an offer to someone else (either later that day or even earlier), who then accepted that offer before E.O.D. Friday...However, I never heard back from Zappos until Tuesday after, once again, I emailed them for a progress report - already knowing the answer. That's what bothered me the most, I think...finding out that they already had someone lined up, but continuing the interview process, anyways. If they had a person lined up, then they should have just cut me loose.

I didn't mention the LinkedIn.com thing to HR, and they were very nice, saying they would forward my resume and application to the Customer Loyalty Team, but that they had already done their hiring for the time being.

Round 2 is the tricky bit. It's a HR interview that tries to figure out if you're the physical incarnation of their fabled company values.

The interview process is fun because they take the pressure off. It's more like talking with friends, and they can ask some crazy questions. The biggest advice I would give would be to be yourself. Don't tell them what you think they want to hear.","On a scale of 1-10, how weird are you and why? Â  Answer Question"

"Dec 29, 2010","Anonymous Interview Candidate in Henderson, NV",Merchandising Assistant Interview,No Offer,Neutral Experience,Easy Interview,"I applied online. The process took 5 weeks. I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Henderson, NV) in September 2010.","I applied for this position via Jobvite and got asked to fill out a formal application then was asked for a phone interview. I was contacted on time by the person they said would be calling me, and the interview lasted about 15 minutes. I communicated with the recruiters through email and they asked me to take the personality questionnaire and then later on a skills test. Later, they asked me to do a Skype interview with the team (I live out of state). I sat in front of my computer and different groups of people (about 2 or 3 at a time) came and spoke to me. I thought it went really well. It lasted about an hour but it felt so quick! It felt like I was just having a conversation with my friends, they asked me a lot about myself and what I could bring to the company. All this time the recruiters were emailing me details about the position, like salary and benefits, leading me to think I had a great chance at the job. After the Skype interview, the lady who could potentially be my boss, said she wanted to meet me in person. I told them to let me know when so I could either drive or fly there, but they said they would love to pay for my plane ticket! A friend of a friend works for the company and she coached me on what I should know; definitely a great help! She said the company is all about culture and being able to fit-in. The company flew me there and put me up in a hotel for the night. I was picked up in the morning and as soon as I arrived at the office, I was given a tour. Great environment and everyone was so nice! The interviews started about an hour after I got there. They put me in a conference room and different groups of people came in to talk to me, pretty much the same ones I talked to via Skype. I thought they could have done a better job coordinating the interview because I repeated myself about ten times throughout the day. I was taken out to lunch, which I knew was part of the interview process, but I didn't feel like I was part of the group. The ladies who took me had their own conversation going and it was tough for me to join in. After lunch, more people came in and spoke to me, and again I was repeating myself and saying the same thing over and over! And two of the interviewers even admitted that. Another thing that made me nervous was that in between interviews, I knew they were all talking to each other about me and comparing notes. The last group of people to talk to me said they felt like I didn't want to be there! I was insulted by that! In previous interviews, it seemed they were impressed with my college degree, even though it wasn't required in the position I applied for and not in the same field of work. Throughout the interview, I tried to emphasize what I had learned in college and show that I can use it in the workplace and be creative and make it work with this position. It felt like they were making me beg for the job. I think actions speak louder than words, but they didn't seem to see it that way. I rearranged my schedule for the past month so I could be available for every test and interview they wanted, and halted my job search because it looked like I was going to get hired. In the email they sent me a few days before the interview they told me ""In respect for your time, if we don't see a mutual fit, we will end the interview process."" I interviewed for FIVE hours, and if they didn't see that I fit in well, they could have sent me away after the second or third time I said my speech. The last group, however, did say that everyone I spoke to liked me and that I would fit in and do well there. So you can imagine my surprise when I received an email a few days later saying that they ""didn't see a mutual fit."" I'm not sure where in the interview I showed that I wasn't serious about wanting the job and being there. Wish I could ask them but too late now. In my opinion, it's a very unusual interview process...and very tedious.","If you could be any superhero, who would you be and why? Â  Answer Question"

I interviewed at The Zappos Family (Henderson, NV) in September 2010.","I applied for the position online. I was called about a week later from their HR department asking to set up an interview. Unfortunately I missed the call, so I left a voicemail for the guy in HR who had called me. He ended up emailing me and asking if I was available for an interview tomorrow. I told him I couldn't make it since I was located in another state and would be relocating. I needed a full 24 hour notice. He then stated that it was a phone interview. I wrote him back and told him I was available and we set up a time for the phone interview. I thought it was weird that the type of interview was not clarified. That was actually the last time I heard back from HR.

The next day I sat around waiting for the interviewer to call me. She finally called about 20 minutes late. She was very nice and friendly, but could not tell me much about the position because it was a new department that was being set up. She did not sound exactly sure what the ""Business Process Coordinator"" was going to be doing. It definitely threw me off guard and made me feel uneasy about the position. The interview was pretty short and I was asked just the basic standard interview questions. None of the zany Zappo interview questions the company is known for.

I was never notified that I didn't get the job and it looks like months later that position is still open. I am not that surprised that the position hasn't been filled because how can they hire someone if they don't even know what they want that person to do?

I was a little disappointed with the whole interview process because I guess I expected a little more professionalism from the #15 company in the US to work for. I was never told anything about the benefits from HR, which aren't the most important thing, but still pretty important.",Why do you want to work for Zappos? Â  Answer Question
