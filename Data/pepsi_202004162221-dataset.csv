"Aug 1, 2018",Anonymous Interview Candidate,Manager Interview,Declined Offer,Negative Experience,Easy Interview,"I worked at Pepsi a few years ago and absolutely loved it, a recruiter reached out asking if I would be interested in working at the company again. I was certainly open to learning more about the opportunity so we set up a phone interview, during the call the recruiter was the complete opposite of what I experienced when I worked at Pepsi.

She seemed very confused when going over the job description, was short during the conversation and a little rude. I think she may be new to recruiting in the US, but it was such a bad experience.

After that chat with her I certainly was not interested in the role, this was a bad experience, but by no means do I think its a reflection of Pepsi. Based upon this experience I would say the company needs to raise the bar for recruiters. For someone who doesn't know the culture of Pepsi this is their first impression and if the recruiters acted like this individual it reflects poorly on the company. Hopefully Pepsi hires recruiters who are a better repersentation of the company",Application,
